"""Radio protocol surface and shared types.

The whole stack above the radio layer (DTMF decode, auth, sessions, services, TTS)
operates on sound-card audio and depends only on the shared :class:`Radio` surface.
CAT tuning (frequency/channel/tone/mode/scan) is a strict superset provided by
:class:`CatRadio`, implemented only by radios with serial control (the TM-V71A).

Guardrail (ADR 0001): PTT is keyed via the DATA port (SignaLink) or the AIOC serial
line — NEVER via a CAT ``TX`` command. ``ptt()`` and ``transmit()`` are the only
keying paths; no CAT method keys the radio. See docs/adr/0002 for the protocol shape.
